@brief driver file for evolving a spiral bay from a straight coastline
@details This file generates a coastline object as a straightline and
evolves it driven by a Gaussian distribution wave climate. The model
boundaries are fixed to represent headlands or seawalls. Sediment is
allowed to escape around these fixed ends, but none is provided into the
model domain.
